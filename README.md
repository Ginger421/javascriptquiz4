The project, 4-js-quiz, is a JavaScript quiz that contains multiple choice questions. It is timed, and, if the correct answer is selected, the amount of time is increased. If the incorrect answer is selected, the amount of time is decreased. The score increments, decrements by 1 point at a time.

When coding the quiz, the elements containing the questions and answers were created dynamically. Questions and answers were created as objects. An event listener was added to the start button and calls the countdown and playGame functions.
